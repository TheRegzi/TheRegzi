## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Front-End Development student at Noroff Vocational School. I started my studies in August 2023 and will finish in June 2025!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve been learning about design, project planning, HTML, CSS and Javascript at my studies so far.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project for myself outside of the studies, which is a weather website called "WeatherWise" which will use a weather API to fetch information about the weather in various places.
  
âš¡ Some facts:
- 26 years old.
- Based in Oslo.
- Previously studied Audiology. I wanted to try something else, and coding caught my interest!
- I have a dog named Nala, she's an Italian Greyhound!
- I love music! ðŸ˜„
- I often go for a jog outside.
